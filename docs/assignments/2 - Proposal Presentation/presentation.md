## Process
- Assigned to Connor
- We will be using the Agile development model for our project because it offers several benefits.
- 1. Early and Continuous Delivery: Agile prioritizes the delivery of working software early and often, which helps in identifying issues, gathering feedback, and making necessary adjustments early in the development process.
- 2. Improved Quality: Frequent testing and quality assurance activities are integral to Agile. This results in higher software quality, as issues are detected and resolved promptly, reducing the chances of delivering a buggy product.
- 3. Risk Management: Agile encourages risk mitigation through regular assessment and adaptation. By breaking down the project into smaller, manageable increments, it becomes easier to identify and manage risks effectively.
- 4.  Customer involvement: Agile encourages active involvement of customers and end-users throughout the development process, ensuring that the product aligns with their expectations and needs.

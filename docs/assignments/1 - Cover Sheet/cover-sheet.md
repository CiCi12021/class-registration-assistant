# 0. Vision
FOR students trying to register for classes

WHO are unable to find sections relevant to them,

THE class registration assistant is a tool that helps them discover 

- Courses that satisfy degree requirements
- Sections taught by professors that they enjoy
- Sections that are not full

UNLIKE the default class registration tool, which does not show whether a class counts towards one's degree

OUR product will incorporate graduation requirements into the system.

# 1. Potential Deliverables
## 1.1 Section View
A webpage that lists all sections meeting a certain criteria. 
Possible features include:

- Sort / Filter by
    - column values
    - degree requirements
    - ratemyprofessors data
- higlight sections taught by professors whose you've taken before
- Automatically choose a Schedule based off of declared Major

## 1.2. Automated Sign-Up
Backend infrastructure that helps students sign up for class.
This could involve

- Reminders - The system could send emails / text when it's time to register
- Automatic Registration - A student would select their desired classes ahead of time, and the program would use COFC's registration API to sign them up for specific classes

## 1.3. Detailed Section Information
A webpage that lists information about a particular section. This could include:
- exhaustive information (eg: all json data) about a section
- A graph showing the history of open seats (to help students anticipate class capacity)

# 2. Potential Integrations
- Use a SQL database to store class info, changes, etc.
- Accept and/or incentivize Ethereum (ETH) Donations/Payment

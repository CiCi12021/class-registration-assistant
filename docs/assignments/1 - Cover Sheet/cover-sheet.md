# Abstract:

Between the years of 2012 and 2020 the United States has seen an increase of roughly 38.2 million vehicle registrations - an increase of around 4.7 million per year. This causes a growing shortage of locations for operators to park their vehicles thus causing new facilities to be built to house these cars - all the while homeowners and landowners leave vacant spaces that could be used by the growing number of motorists. ParkD is a web application that provides a parking service similar to how AirBnB provides a service for temporarily renting houses. After registering with personal, vehicle, and financial details, users can explore parking spots within a certain area that fit their desired criteria and then book these spots for the price listed by the host. These exchanges will occur through blockchain transactions through Hyperledger Fabric, allowing it to be secure through decentralization. Renters will be able to make money off their unused space, drivers will be able to find cheap and local parking, and the environment will benefit from less construction to compensate for the increasing number of vehicles.

# Vision:
FOR drivers and property owners.

WHO are looking for cheap parking and property owners who want to rent out their parking spaces.

THE ParkD application is a parking service.

THAT connects drivers with parking space owners and helps drivers to search for cheap available parking

relative to ordinary parking services.

UNLIKE BestParking, in that ParkD displays the type of parking environment making for better ease of

use in finding the location by sight rather than street names. ParkD is also different from the local

competitor XpressPark in that it relies on decentralized technology for greater security.

OUR product is more secure because it is built using Hyperledger, is easy to use, and is cheaper for users.
